NCC is an ISO certified company with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 & OHSAS 18001certificates. \nIn early 1997 we launched our tunneling division using the state of the art micro tunneling technology and pipe jacking method. Since that time we have successfully constructed and more than 80 KM of pipe lines of varying diameters by the non-disruptive method using the ISEKI TCC 600, ISEKI TCC 800, HERRENKNECHT AVN 600, AVN 800B, AVN 800A, AVN 1000, AVN 1200, AVN 1400, AVN 1600, AVN 1800 & AVN 2500\u00a0 micro tunneling machines in diverse ground conditions, with and without ground water tables at different soil strata. \nPipe lines constructed by the non-disruptive method were primarily in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi for such clients as Abu Dhabi Municipality, Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company (ADSSC), the public works and ADWEA & TRANSCO (ADDC). We have also carried out tunneling works in Dubai for Dubai Municipality and M/s. DEWA, as well as in Sharjah and Ajman for the local municipalities. \nThe construction of pipe lines utilizing the non-disruptive method has been carried out by using micro tunneling technologies in two ways: (a) by encasing the carrier pipe which in most cases GRP/GRE with a reinforced concrete and jack it directly to the correct line and level or (b) by jacking a steel or RC pipe as a sleeve, installing the carrier pipe in side it and grouting the annulus space by a non-shrink grout or a foam concrete. \nWe have constructed more than 900 lines with lengths varying from 35meters to 300 meters utilizing the non-disruptive method.\u00a0 \u00a0As part of our continued growth and development, we \u00a0have recently equipped the company to carry out long drives of up to 600 meters for pipe diameters of 1200mm & above, and an internal diameter of up to 3 meters. The constructed pipelines were related to 77 projects in the U.A.E. for sewerage, Irrigation and water pipe lines. \nWe have successfully jacked more than 80 Km of pipe lines, ranging from 500mm to 2400mm in internal diameter,\u00a0 crossing under existing road (sub main & main roads), existing services, existing gas and fuel lines and under lakes. We have further successfully jacked pipes with a cover ranging from 2 meter to 22 meters in varying soil conditions. \nThe company currently owns 17 tunneling machines valued at over 40 million dirhams. Our machines are sourced from leading manufacturers of tunneling machines to ensure we remain at the cutting edge of the tunneling business.\u00a0 Two (2) of our machines are manufactured by ISEKI-Japan and thirteen (15) are manufactured by Herrenknecht \u2013 Germany. The machines are of varying diameters and can jack pipes from 500mm ID to 3000mm ID pipes. \nWhile our commitment to the advances in technology put us at the forefront of the tunneling business, we acknowledge that this would not be possible without our staff.\u00a0 We take pride in our expert staff and highly trained and experienced operators and their commitment to the company and to our valued clients.\u00a0 We have and continue to invest in our staff by developing ongoing training programs because we firmly believe that the long term success and sustainability of a business is directly linked to its management and staff.", "url": "http://www.oilandgasdirectory.com/profile/details/32833/Al-Nubla-General-Contracting-Co-LLC.html", "country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": "P.O.Box 35152, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "email": "alnubla@emirates.net.ae", "company_name": "Al Nubla General Contracting Co LLC"}
